This simulation will be looking at the Pokemon video games, specifically Pokemon X. It will determine the average minimum number of steps it takes for the player to encounter at least one of every Pokemon that can be found in each location. 

The two random variables will be the number of steps between wild Pokemon encounters (a range of 1-? : still to be determined), and the percent chance of encountering each Pokemon in a location (information which is readily available online).

Some background for anyone not familiar with the Pokemon games: in the games, when your player walks in certain areas (grass, caves, or water) in each location (usually defined by 'Route x' or 'Cave y'), there is a chance for an encounter with a random wild Pokemon after a random number of steps. The Pokemon and the chance of their encounters differ by each clearly defined location. I will not take into consideration different genders of the same Pokemon (which can have different encounter rates), and will consider all steps taken to be where wild Pokemon encounters can occur. Each location will be calculated and simulated separately (e.g., 100,000 trials for Route 1, 100,000 for Route 2, etc.). 

For example, in Route 1, Pokemon A has a 12.5% chance of being encountered, Pokemon B has a 50% chance, and Pokemon C has an 80% chance. What is the average minimum number of steps the player must take to encounter all three Pokemon at least once?
